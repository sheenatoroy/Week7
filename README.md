# Class Box Data Validation

Instructions: 
Given a geometric figure box with parameters length, width and height. 
Model a class Box that can be instantiated by the same three parameters. Exposing the outside world only method for returning the computed surface area, lateral surface area and its volume. A box's should not be a zero or negative number. Perform data validation for each parameter given to the constructor. 

- Setting the width, length and height. Inside the parameter it has a value which are the variable that holds a entered number
- Using the getter method, it returns the value that sets by entering a number to the question or **system.out.print**
- To compute the volume, surface area and lateral, using the getter method the formula of these three are declared there. 
- By declaring the **this.getMethod** at the method of showing the output of the result of volume, surface area and laterals of the box.
